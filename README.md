# Video-Compression-Using-Parallelism
Given an existing video compression tool, this program speeds up the tool using parallelism. 
This tool receives a folder with uncompressed image files (".ppm" extension) and creates a single zip file with all images after compression. The images in the input folder will have the frame number in their file name, and the output zip file follows lexicographical order.
